# Graph-Algorithms
This Python project implements fundamental graph algorithms: Single Source Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree, and Strongly Connected Components. These algorithms are essential in various applications, including network routing, data analysis, and optimization problems.

Implemented Algorithms
1. Single Source Shortest Path
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

2. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
Kruskal's Algorithm: Finds the minimum spanning tree using a greedy approach.

3. Strongly Connected Components (SCC)
Kosaraju's Algorithm: Identifies strongly connected components in a directed graph.
